ðŸš¦ **Understanding Road Accident Trends with Data** ðŸš¦  

This project analyzes road accident data to uncover patterns and trends, providing actionable insights for improving road safety. Using SQL for data analysis and Tableau for visualization, this project highlights key factors contributing to road accidents, helping stakeholders make informed decisions.

## **Dataset Description**  

The dataset includes information on:  
- **Accident Severity**: Categorized as Fatal, Serious, or Slight.  
- **Accident Date**: Date of the accident.  
- **Geographic Data**: Latitude and longitude of accident locations.  
- **Light Conditions**: Daylight, darkness, and lighting quality.  
- **District Area**: Urban or rural areas where accidents occurred.  
- **Number of Casualties**: Total casualties in an accident.  
- **Road Type and Surface Conditions**: Type of road and surface conditions like wet, dry, or icy.  
- **Weather Conditions**: Weather during the accident (rain, fog, clear, etc.).  
- **Vehicle Type**: Type of vehicles involved in accidents (car, motorcycle, etc.).

## **Technologies Used**  
- **SQL**: For querying, filtering, and deriving insights from the dataset.  
- **Tableau**: For creating professional visualizations to interpret results.  
- **HTML**: For showcasing key findings on a web interface.

## **Key Outcomes and Results**  

### **1. Accident Severity Trends**  
- Urban areas had higher accident frequency, but rural areas showed higher fatality rates.  
- **Recommendation**: Implement stricter speed limits and better emergency response services in rural areas.

### **2. Weather Impact**  
- Rainy and foggy conditions increased accident frequency, especially on wet roads.  
- **Recommendation**: Improve drainage systems and enforce reduced speed limits during adverse weather.  

### **3. Lighting and Timing**  
- Daytime accidents were more frequent, but nighttime accidents had higher severity.  
- **Recommendation**: Install better street lighting in accident-prone areas.

### **4. Road Type and Surface Conditions**  
- Single carriageways were the most accident-prone road types. Wet surfaces were often associated with severe accidents.  
- **Recommendation**: Upgrade road surfaces and drainage infrastructure to prevent accidents.

### **5. Vehicle Type and Casualties**  
- Cars were involved in most accidents, but motorcycles and heavy vehicles caused higher casualties.  
- **Recommendation**: Conduct targeted safety campaigns for motorcyclists and heavy vehicle operators.

### **6. Geographical Hotspots**  
- Urban hotspots like Kensington saw frequent accidents, while rural areas faced more severe accidents.  
- **Recommendation**: Focus urban interventions on accident hotspots and strengthen rural infrastructure.

## **Key Visualizations**  

Tableau is being used to create visualizations for:  
- Accident trends by severity, area, and time.  
- Weather and road conditions impact.  
- Vehicle involvement and casualty analysis.

## **How to Run the Project**  

1. **SQL Analysis**: Review the SQL queries used for analyzing the dataset to understand the key trends and patterns.  
2. **Tableau Dashboards**: Open the Tableau visualizations (under development) to interact with the analyzed data.  

## **Future Enhancements**  

- Complete Tableau visualizations for a more interactive experience.  
- Include machine learning predictions for accident likelihood based on conditions.

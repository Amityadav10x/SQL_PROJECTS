## COVID-19 Data Analysis Project

### Project Overview

This project involves analyzing a COVID-19 dataset using SQL. The goal is to enhance my SQL skills by solving a variety of basic, intermediate, and advanced SQL questions.

### Dataset Description

The dataset contains information about COVID-19 cases across various countries. Below are the columns included in the dataset:

- `country`: The name of the country.
- `continent`: The continent to which the country belongs.
- `confirmed`: Total confirmed cases.
- `deaths`: Total deaths.
- `recovered`: Total recovered cases.
- `active`: Total active cases.
- `tests`: Total tests conducted.
- `population`: Population of the country.
- `new_cases`: Daily new cases.
- `new_deaths`: Daily new deaths.
- `serious_critical`: Number of serious or critical cases.
- `total_cases_per_million`: Total cases per 1 million population.
- `total_deaths_per_million`: Total deaths per 1 million population.
- `total_tests_per_million`: Total tests per 1 million population.
- `new_cases_per_million`: Daily new cases per 1 million population.
- `new_deaths_per_million`: Daily new deaths per 1 million population.

### Learnings

By working through these SQL questions, I have gain the following skills:

1. **Basic SQL Queries:**
   - Selecting and filtering data using `SELECT` and `WHERE`.
   - Sorting data using `ORDER BY`.
   - Counting records with `COUNT()`.
   - Summing values with `SUM()`.
   - Using comparison operators for filtering (e.g., `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`).

2. **Intermediate SQL Queries:**
   - Using aggregate functions like `AVG()`, `SUM()`, `COUNT()`, `MIN()`, `MAX()`.
   - Grouping data with `GROUP BY`.
   - Filtering grouped data with `HAVING`.
   - Combining multiple conditions in a query with `AND` and `OR`.
   - Writing queries that return specific columns and conditions.

3. **Advanced SQL Queries:**
   - Using subqueries to perform operations on subsets of data.
   - Implementing joins to combine data from multiple tables.
   - Using window functions like `ROW_NUMBER()`, `RANK()`, `DENSE_RANK()`.
   - Performing complex calculations and transformations.
   - Grouping and aggregating data by multiple columns.
   - Filtering data based on calculated columns or measures.
   - Applying advanced filtering with subqueries and joins.




### How to Use

1. **Set Up the Database:**
   - Import the dataset into your preferred SQL database system.
   - Ensure all columns are correctly formatted and data types are set appropriately.

2. **Practice SQL Queries:**
   - Start with the basic queries to get familiar with the dataset.
   - Progress to more complex queries, including aggregations, joins, and subqueries.
   - Attempt advanced functions and window functions to analyze data trends.
   - Use complex conditions and case statements for detailed data classification.

### Conclusion

This project aims to provide hands-on practice with a real-world dataset to enhance our SQL skills. By working through these questions, you'll gain experience in various SQL techniques and be better prepared for data analysis tasks in professional settings.

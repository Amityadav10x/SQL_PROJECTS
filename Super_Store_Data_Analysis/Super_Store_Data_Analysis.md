# Superstore Data Analysis Project

## Objective
The objective of this project is to analyze and extract meaningful insights from a Superstore dataset using SQL. The project addresses 50 SQL questions that cover a broad range of SQL operations, including:

1. Basic Data Retrieval
2. Aggregation and Grouping
3. Filtering and Sorting
4. Joining and Relationships
5. Date and Time Functions
6. Subqueries
7. Window Functions
8. Advanced Filtering
9. Data Modification
10. Complex Queries

## Dataset
The dataset contains information related to sales, customers, products, and shipping details of a superstore. It includes fields such as order ID, customer name, product category, sales amount, profit, and more.

## SQL Queries
The project involves executing 50 SQL queries that aim to:
- Retrieve, aggregate, and analyze sales and customer data.
- Identify trends, patterns, and outliers in the dataset.
- Perform operations like filtering, sorting, and joining to derive insights.
- Use advanced SQL functions like subqueries, window functions, and complex queries.

## Results
The analysis provides insights into:
- Top-performing products and categories.
- Customer buying behavior and preferences.
- Regional sales performance.
- Profitability and discounts.
- Shipping modes and delivery performance.

## Conclusion
The Superstore SQL project offers a detailed exploration of the store's data through various SQL queries. The insights gained can be used to make informed business decisions, improve operational efficiency, and enhance customer satisfaction. This project showcases the importance of SQL in business analytics and data-driven decision-making.

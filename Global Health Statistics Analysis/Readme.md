## Objectives
The primary objectives of this analysis include:
1. Identifying diseases with significant impact in terms of DALYs, Mortality Rate, and Recovery Rate.
2. Calculating and analyzing metrics such as median and average values for key indicators.
3. Ranking diseases by impact within age groups and countries.
4. Exploring relationships between healthcare access, treatment availability, and outcomes.

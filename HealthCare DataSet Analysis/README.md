## Overview

This project involves analyzing a healthcare dataset with various patient details, including medical conditions, admission information, billing amounts, and treatment outcomes. The goal is to practice SQL by solving queries that would help in making informed decisions in the healthcare sector.

## Dataset Description

The dataset consists of the following columns:

- **Name**: Patient's name
- **Age**: Patient's age
- **Gender**: Patient's gender
- **Blood Type**: Patient's blood type
- **Medical Condition**: The medical condition diagnosed
- **Date of Admission**: The date the patient was admitted
- **Doctor**: The doctor responsible for the patient
- **Hospital**: The hospital where the patient was admitted
- **Insurance Provider**: The insurance provider covering the patient
- **Billing Amount**: The total billing amount for the patient's treatment
- **Room Number**: The room number where the patient stayed
- **Admission Type**: Type of admission (e.g., Urgent, Emergency)
- **Discharge Date**: The date the patient was discharged
- **Medication**: The medication prescribed to the patient
- **Test Results**: The results of the patient's medical tests

## SQL Practice Levels

### Basic Level

- Retrieving patient names and medical conditions.
- Filtering patients based on admission type, medical condition, and other criteria.
- Sorting and retrieving specific columns.
- Filtering patients by dates, age, and gender.

### Intermediate Level

- Grouping and aggregating billing amounts by hospital, doctor, or medical condition.
- Calculating averages, maximums, and minimums.
- Working with date ranges and performing calculations like age at admission.
- Using subqueries and joins to retrieve detailed information.
- Handling conditions like billing amount above average or finding patients by specific criteria.

### Advanced Level

- Using window functions for cumulative billing and ranking.
- Performing complex joins with additional tables.
- Advanced date filtering and conditional aggregation.
- Pivoting data for detailed analysis.
- Utilizing recursive queries and correlated subqueries for in-depth insights.

## How to Use

1. Load the dataset into a SQL database.
2. Execute the provided SQL queries to practice various SQL concepts.
3. Modify and expand upon the queries to explore the dataset further.

## Project Goal

This project is intended to enhance your SQL skills while providing insights that could be valuable in a healthcare context, such as identifying high-cost patients, tracking medication effectiveness, and more.

## Conclusion

By completing this project, you will gain a deeper understanding of SQL and its application in healthcare data analysis, helping to make data-driven decisions that can improve patient outcomes.

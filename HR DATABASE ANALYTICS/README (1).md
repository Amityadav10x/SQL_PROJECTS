## Introduction
This project is centered around practicing SQL queries to enhance my skills in data analysis and database management. The dataset used for this practice is an HR dataset that includes various employee-related attributes. The questions crafted for this project are designed to reflect real-world scenarios, helping HR professionals to manage their workforce effectively.

## Project Description
The project involves writing and executing SQL queries on a provided HR dataset. The dataset includes information such as employee ID, age, department, salary, job satisfaction, attrition status, and more. The goal is to extract meaningful insights that can help in decision-making processes within an HR department.

## SQL Questions
Below are the 35 SQL questions that were crafted to guide the practice:

1. How many employees have left the company, grouped by age group?
2. What is the average monthly income of employees who have not left the company?
3. What percentage of employees with over 5 years at the company are satisfied with their job?
4. Which department has the highest number of employees working overtime?
5. What is the average daily rate for each job role?
6. How many employees are in each salary slab?
7. What is the average number of years an employee stays in their current role before leaving the company?
8. How many employees are single, married, and divorced, grouped by gender?
9. What is the distribution of employees' educational fields across different departments?
10. What is the average training time per year for employees who have received a promotion?
11. How many employees have a work-life balance rating of 3 or above?
12. What is the total number of employees in each job role who are at risk of attrition?
13. How many employees have worked in more than one company before joining?
14. What is the average performance rating of employees in each department?
15. Which job roles have the highest average number of total working years?
16. What is the average percent salary hike for employees who have worked for more than 2 companies?
17. How many employees in the '18-25' age group are in the 'Sales' department?
18. What is the relationship between stock option levels and job satisfaction?
19. How many employees have never taken part in overtime, grouped by their job involvement rating?
20. What is the distribution of employees' environment satisfaction ratings across different departments?
21. How many employees have completed no training in the last year?
22. Which business travel category is most common among employees who have left the company?
23. What is the average hourly rate of employees grouped by their education field?
24. How many employees have a job level of 2 or higher and are in the Research & Development department?
25. What is the average distance from home for employees in each department?
26. How many employees with a job satisfaction rating of 4 are in the 'Life Sciences' education field?
27. What is the average daily rate for employees who work in sales roles?
28. How many employees have been with their current manager for more than 3 years?
29. What is the most common marital status among employees in the 'Research & Development' department?
30. How many employees have stock options and work in the 'Laboratory Technician' role?
31. What is the relationship between education level and percent salary hike?
32. How many employees are in each performance rating category?
33. What is the average job involvement score for employees who travel frequently for business?
34. How many employees have a standard working hour of 80?
35. What is the average work-life balance rating for employees who have received a salary hike of more than 10%?

## Key Learnings
Through this SQL practice project, I have gained:

- **Proficiency in SQL**: Strengthened my understanding of various SQL concepts such as joins, subqueries, aggregate functions, grouping, and ordering.
- **Problem-Solving Skills**: Developed the ability to approach complex business questions and translate them into SQL queries that extract relevant insights.
- **Data Interpretation**: Improved skills in interpreting and analyzing data outputs to provide actionable recommendations for HR management.
- **Real-World Application**: Gained experience in dealing with HR-related data, which is essential for making informed decisions in workforce management.

## Tools and Technologies Used
- **SQL**: Primary tool for writing and executing queries.
- **MySQL Workbench**: Used as the environment for query execution and data analysis.
- **Excel**: For initial data exploration and summary statistics.

## Future Enhancements
- **Advanced Query Optimization**: Explore and implement more advanced techniques to optimize query performance for large datasets.
- **Additional Scenarios**: Create more complex and diverse scenarios that involve advanced SQL concepts such as window functions, recursive queries, and CTEs (Common Table Expressions).
- **Visualization**: Integrate data visualization tools like Power BI or Tableau to present the findings in a more interactive and visually appealing manner.
